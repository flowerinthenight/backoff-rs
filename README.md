**backoff-rs** implements jittered backoff. Useful when retrying operations that can potentially fail (i.e. network calls). The implementation is based on [this article](https://www.awsarchitectureblog.com/2015/03/backoff.html) from the AWS Architecture Blog.

You can use it like so:

``` rust
todo
```
